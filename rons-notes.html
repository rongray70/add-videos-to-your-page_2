		<p>HTML is <b><em>reasonably</em> straightforward</b></p>
		<p>Line breaks (br)<br>are called inline tags while paragraph (p) tags are block 
			tags.  Block tags can optionally have a defined height/width.</p>

		<p>Have realized that I am not a note-taker for some of this stuff... not much to 
			put into 'code' for Work Session 1.</p>
		<p>'div' is used for blocks and the class can be used with css for styling.</p>
		<p>'span' is used inline and can also have classes that can be defined in css.</p>
		<p>Don't really see all of the point of 'span' yet... am guessing it will be more 
			obvious once we get into css.</p>
		<p>I really wish the class had a better table of contents or more obvious way of 
			seeing where you are at versus where you were last at.  Tried going back a few 
			videos to review and then had to keep skipping through videos I had already 
			seen before finally figuring out where I had been.</p>

		Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure
	</div>
	<div class="notes">
		<p>Order matters when defining css.</p>
		<p>You could also use 'style' within the 'head' section of an html page to 
			define styles, but using a separate css file allows you to apply/modify 
			your style across multiple pages without having to update each html page.</p>
		<p>You could even add style settings in the 'div'.</p>
		<p>An exhaustive css reference is available at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">mozilla</a>.</p>
		<p>Boxes have:  margin / border / padding / content</p>
		<p>HTML and CSS can be validated:
			<ul>
				<li>To verify HTML: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a></li>
				<li>To verify CSS: <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input</a></li>

		<p>We will be using Python, which is an interpreted language versus 
			compiled code.</p>
		<p>Backus-Naur Form: &lt;non-terminal&gt; -> &lt;replacement&gt; (terminal)
			<br>Derivation: Replacing non-terminals with replacements (terminals) 
			until the non-terminals have all been replaced by terminal values.

		<div class="subheading">Python</div>
		<p>Can get substrings using the expression &lt;string_variable&gt; [ &lt;expression&gt; : 
			&lt;expression&gt; ]
			<br>strVariable[3:3] would return the same thing as strVariable[3]
			<br>strVariable[3:5] would return character positions 4-6
			<br>strVariable[3:] would return from position 4 to the end of the string
			<br>strVariable[-5:] would return the last 5 characters of the string
		</p>
		<p>Search strings using .find, in the format &lt;string_variable&gt;.find(&lt;substring&gt;, 
			&lt;starting_position&gt;)
			<br>the return value is the position of the first character of the substring, 
			starting at the (optional) starting_position
			<br>a -1 return value indicates that the substring value was not found
		</p>
		<p>Multi-line strings can be created using triple quotes:
			<br>print """
				Here is the first line
				And here is the second line
				And here is the third line
			"""
		</p>
		<p>Procedures/functions are defined as:
			<br>def function_name (input_variable[,input_variable...])
			<br>use 'return &lt;variable&gt;' to return a value from the function
		</p>
		<p>Why use functions?  Portability - a function in one app might be usable in 
			another; Efficiency - code that is repeated can be placed in a function and 
			called multiple times; Readability - proper function names help to make 
			your code more legible and easier to follow</p>
		<p>While (condition):</p>
		<p>if (condition): else:</p>
		<p>Lists can be created by specifying list_name = [item1, item2, ...]</p>
		<p>Lists are mutable.</p>
		<p>List assignments act more like pointers (called aliasing) so if p=[1,2,3] 
			and you do q=p then q and p will both point to the same list!</p>
		<p>for &lt;variable&gt; in &lt;list_variable&gt;:
			<br>items to execute
		</p>
		<p>&lt;value&gt; [not] in &lt;list&gt; allows us to locate items in a list, 
			returning a boolean value.</p>
		<p>list_element.index(search_value) allows us to locate the index value for 
			the first instance of search_value in list_element.</p>

		<p>Module: file containing (often common) sets of functions.</p>
		<p>Abstraction is when we cannot see "inside" the function we are using.</p>
		<p>Python documentation link: https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html</p>
		<p>When using os.listdir on a Windows PC, you need to preceed the path with 
			an r (for raw pack) which instructs the compiler not to modify or adjust 
			the path string.  For example: os.listdir(r"C:\Program Files\")</p>
		<p>The "turtle" file contains a "Turtle" class from which we can make instances.</p>
		<p>Twilio is an external (non-Python) shared library.  It can be used to send 
			text messages.</p>
		<p>Google's Python style guide available at: 
			http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html</p>
		<p>Classes allow you to re-use definitions and methods without having to re-define 
			everything for every instance you need.</p>
		<p>Library is simply a group of classes, generally organized together as groups of 
			common functions/methods (ie, turtle, twilio, standard library, etc).  Multiple
			modules might create a library.</p>
		<p>Define classes in a class file, so that they can be used in multiple areas of 
			your code when you have larger projects - also keeps it oop/reusable!</p>
		<p>The __init__ function is a constructor... it creates (constructs) your instance.</p>
		<p>Instance variables are those variables which belong to a specific instance.</p>
		<p>Instance methods are methods (functions) which belong to or are available to 
			an instance.</p>
		<p>Class variables are ones defined within a class (above the init).  They are akin 
			to global variables for the class.</p>
		<p>Python class just like others -> objects are specific instances of a class item.</p>
		<p>Great description differentiating class and object and python's use of classes: 
			http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex42.html</p>
		<p>Method overriding is when a child contains a method already specified in a parent 
			class.  The child method, when called, will use the child's method, not the parent's 
			method.</p>
		<p>Tons of non-standard classes already exist - use google - check for someone else's 
			library first before recreating the wheel.  just download and import the classes 
			you need.  modify methods you don't like by overriding.</p>
		<p>OOP is a design wherein you define classes and methods rather than specific elements.  For
			example, you might create a 'dog' class which defines various attributes (hair length,
			temperment) and methods to interact with an element (walk, feed, play).  You can now use
			this class to create as many instances/objects of a dog as you need.  Without OOP you would
			be defining the doggy attributes/methods each time you created a new 'dog', but with OOP
			you need only do that once in a class.  This makes alterations much quicker and simpler, 
			as alterations or additions can be made in one class which will	then affect all of the 
			instances using that class.  For example, you could add a 'size' attribute, which would
			then become available to all instances of all dogs.  Without OOP and classes you would 
			have to make changes to the definitions of each instance.  It's very similar to CSS... 
			rather than defining the particular attributes you want for each and every paragraph in
			your html document you can simply create a paragraph style class which defines how all 
			instances of a paragraph should appear (normal weight, 10px, etc).  Should you decide that
			all paragraphs need to be sans serif, then only one change is needed (to the paragraph
			class) and all paragraphs will subsequently have the change.</p>
		<p>Inheritance occurs when subclasses inherit the features of a parent class.  This can
			be done with class variables as well as class methods.  The simplist example I know of
			relates back to cascading style sheets.  A body element might have a definition for
			a particular font (Times New Roman).  All of the sub-elements of body (headings,
			paragraphs, etc) will inherit this font selection.  This saves the necessity of having
			to explicitly define the font for each sub-element.  It (again) also allows for quick 
			changes if the developer decides to use Arial instead... one change is made to the
			body font-family and all sub-elements subsequently use that font.  As with python class
			variables and methods, specific selections can still be overwritten should the developer
			choose to do so.</p>

		<p>Network: group of entities that can communicate, even though they are not all directly
			connected</p>
		<p>Latency: time that it takes for a message to travel from source to destination</p>
		<p>Bandwidth: amount of information that can be transmitted per unit time; rate of
			data which can be transmitted (ie, bps)</p>
		<p>Bit: smallest unit of information</p>
		<p>Protocol: set of agreed-upon rules which dictate how two entities talk to each other. An
			example is http.</p>
		<p>URL: uniform resource locator</p>
		<p>query parameter: parameters which can be passed in the URL (?x=1&amp;y=2...)</p>
		<p>fragment: indentified in query parameter using hash (#) and occurs at end of list;
			references a particular part of the page; not sent to server, used by browser</p>
		<p>http has a method, path, and version: for example
			<br>http://www.example.com/foo
			<br>GET /foo HTTP/1.1 is sent to www.example.com on port 80</p>
		<p>An http request generally contains multiple headers:
			<br>host: indicates the host server/name/address
			<br>user-agent: indicates the app used to make the request (chrome, ie, ffox)</p>
		<p>http responses are sent back from the server; example response:
			<br>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</p>
		<p>Responses can also contain multiple headers:
			<br>Date: indicates server's timestamp
			<br>Server: name/version number of server app (ie, Apache/2.2.3)
			<br>Content-Type: type of data returning (ie, text/html)
			<br>Content-Length: length of content</p>
		<p>Purpose of a 'server' is to respond to requests</p>
		<p>Types of responses:
			<br>static: existing file or image
			<br>dynamic: response created based on request, generally created by web application</p>
		<p>forms: not a lot of notes here. background: In 2000 I wrote a project application for my
		deparment using ASP. The app interfaces with Microsoft SQL Server to store various project
		information and Microsoft's SMTP service to send emails.</p>
		<p>url encoding (or escaping): translate your query parameters to a properly formatted url</p>
